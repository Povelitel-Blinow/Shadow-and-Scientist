This was my biggest 2D game so far. The code is a bit messy because this game **was made is 2 weeks** for a game jam. Some of the mechanics are pretty weird because I haven't had much experience in 2D.

It was my biggest 2D game until I joined the team. We are creating a **2D metroidvania**. I've been working on it for almost 6 months now. My 2D developer skills and code style have improved significantly. Hopefully, I'll be able to showcase some of my achievements later.
